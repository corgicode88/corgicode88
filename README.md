- 👋 Hi, I’m @corgicode88
- 👀 I am interested in programming languages such as Java and Python, and I enjoy learning new things and solving problems.
  I use GitHub to showcase my projects and collaborate with other developers.
- 🌱 Some of the projects that I have worked on are:
    A Java program that simulates a corgi's behavior and personality. It can bark, wag its tail, play fetch, and do tricks.
      It also has a graphical user interface that displays the corgi's mood and status. You can find the source code and screenshots of this project
    A Python script that generates random names for corgis based on their gender, color, and personality. It uses a list of common corgi names and adjectives, and combines them with some logic and creativity.
      You can find the source code and examples of this project 
- 💞️ I hope you find my projects interesting and useful. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from you.
-   You can contact me through my GitHub profile or my email address. Thank you for visiting my page and happy coding! blush
